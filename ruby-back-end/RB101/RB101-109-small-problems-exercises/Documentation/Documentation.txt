1.
path(path) → string
Returns the string representation of the path
File.path("/dev/null")          #=> "/dev/null"
File.path(Pathname.new("/tmp")) #=> "/tmp"

path → filename
to_path → filename

Returns the pathname used to create file as a string. Does not normalize the name.

The pathname may not point to the file corresponding to file. For instance, the pathname becomes void when the file has been moved or deleted.

This method raises IOError for a file created using File::Constants::TMPFILE because they don't have a pathname.



The definiton for the File::path method and the File#path method are above.

The obvious difference is that one is a Class method and one is an instance method.
